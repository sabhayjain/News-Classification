With both Class X and Class XII CBSE results, Delhi government schools’ performance stands out. The steady improvement of recent years continued this year too. For Class XII the overall pass percentage of Delhi stood at 94.4% but government schools delivered 97.8% success – behind only the government schools of Bengaluru and Thiruvananthapuram. For Class X too, while Delhi continues to lag most of the country, improved performance by government and government-aided schools helped the region record its highest increase in the pass figure from 80.9% last year to 85.9% now.
Talk of the Delhi model of education has been building up through the AAP government’s first term. In its first budget of the second term too it allocated a high 26% of the total budget to the education sector. Money combined with policy focus, administrative attention, and accountability appears to have delivered results.
The budget was in February, before the pandemic sank its teeth into India. A lot of budgetary calculations now need revising. But the pandemic has also underlined the critical importance of robust government services in critical sectors. Healthcare is certainly one, so is education. Good schooling in the early years is really the key building block for the full development of a child’s potential. While the poor quality of many government schools has been pushing up enrollment in private schools, a majority of India’s students still attend government schools. Better learning outcomes here are critical to our children’s future.
